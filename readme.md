# javanaise

As part of the [distributed systems and applications course](http://lig-membres.imag.fr/boyer/html/Documents/cours/JAVANAISE/index.htm) at Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, I built this distributed object cache.

You are on the **master** branch, the code is stored within the [v1](https://github.com/m5r/javanaise/tree/v1) and the [v2](https://github.com/m5r/javanaise/tree/v2) branches. Each of these branches corresponds to steps during the project development.
